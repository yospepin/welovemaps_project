# welovemaps_project: Income and Racial shifts in Minnesota

This project focuses on exploring the trends in personal income of Minnesotans from the year 2012 to 2022, along with shifts in the racial makup of the population. The files used in this project are all in the "[welovemaps_shiny]()" folder in the "[code](https://github.com/yospepin/welovemaps_project/tree/main/code)" folder of this repository. The county level datasets came from government census website sources. More about them in Milestone1. The track level data was collected using an API, directly from RStudio. These were then wrangled and saved as an RDS file.
