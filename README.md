# welovemaps_project: Income and Racial shifts in Minnesota

### Abstract
This project focuses on exploring the trends in personal income of Minnesotans from the year 2012 to 2022, along with shifts in the racial makup of the population. The files used in this project are all in the "[welovemaps_shiny](https://github.com/yospepin/welovemaps_project/tree/main/code/welovemaps_shiny)" folder in the "[code](https://github.com/yospepin/welovemaps_project/tree/main/code)" folder of this repository. The county level datasets came Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce website. More about them in [Milestone1](https://github.com/yospepin/welovemaps_project/tree/main/planning). The final product of this project is a shiny app displaying racial and income make ups of Minnesota on both county and track level, and can be found in the [welovemaps_shiny](https://github.com/yospepin/welovemaps_project/tree/main/code/welovemaps_shiny) folder, or on the link in this Read Me.

## Introduction
Our main research question for this project is "How do shifts in racial and ethnic population demographics correlate with income changes across Minnesota counties over the past decade?". Through this project, we tried to explore how economic gaps among racial and ethnic groups might affect income levels and access to economic opportunities, and by doing so, highlight any economic challenges faced by diverse communities, and provide insights for policies that promote inclusion and equity.
